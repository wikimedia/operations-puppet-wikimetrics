# We are using exec rather than the script stanza as script runs a shell to execute
# the command. Hence, the sh process is parent of the real process,
# and upstart tracks sh process instead of real process.
# If we need to use the script stanza in the future we need to use it together with
# "expect fork" as "except fork" makes upstart track the first forked pid (the one
# we are interested in) instead of the sh process.
# By using exec when possible there is no parent sh process in first place,
# so upstart tracks the real process right away.
